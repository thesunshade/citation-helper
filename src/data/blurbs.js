Typically a deity approaches the Buddha in the monastery at Sāvatthī, illuminating the night with their glory. The deity addresses the Buddha with a question or verse, which may be a praise, a challenge, a riddle, or simply a reflection. The Buddha responds, usually elevating the discourse to a higher plane. As always in Buddhist texts, a deity is not worshiped, but is regarded as a temporary rebirth in a higher plane; the deities learn from the Buddha, not the other way around. In most cases, the narrative framework is slim, and after a while it is dropped entirely, retaining just the verses. There’s no particular theme to the discourses, which range from the simple to the profound.",
  sn2: "The “Linked Discourses on Gods” contains 30 discourses, each one of which depicts the Buddha in conversation with a god. Here the term devaputta is used, rather than devatā in the previous saṁyutta. The difference is purely nominal and there is no difference in the meaning. The style of discourses is similar to the “Linked Discourses on Deities”, although here there is a greater emphasis on the theme of renunciation. A number of these discourses are regularly recited in modern Theravāda; the Tāyana verses on diligent striving at SN 2.8 are often recited by monastics, while the discourses on the sun and the moon (SN 2.9 and SN 2.10) are popular protection chants, which are also found in Tibetan.",
  sn3: "The “Linked Discourses with the Kosalan” contains 25 discourses featuring King Pasenadi of Kosala. Pasenadi shines through in the early texts as a complex human figure, one with foibles and foolishness, but with a great devotion and capacity to grow. He appears frequently elsewhere in the suttas; MN 87 tells the story of how Queen Mallikā led him to the Dhamma. Here Mallikā appears again, and in SN 3.8 she shows how she is not afraid to challenge her king. The suttas in this collection typically set the verses in substantive prose narratives, illustrating the struggles and problems that beset a king intent on Dhamma who must nonetheless rule in a world with spies, sacrifices, punishments, wars, and the many temptations of royal life.",
  sn4: "The “Linked Discourses with Māra” contains 25 discourses featuring Māra, the god of temptation, deceit, and death. In these discourses, Māra typically appears in some terrifying or beguiling form, hoping to disturb the Buddha, or else he challenges the Buddha with a critical verse. Like the previous section, the narrative prose here is substantive. The Buddha recognizes him at once and exposes his deceit in a verse. Māra also appears throughout the next collection, where the nuns take him on. ",
  sn5: "The “Linked Discourses with Nuns” contains 10 discourses describing occasions when various nuns retreat to a forest for meditation, only to be challenged by Māra. The verses here partly overlap with the Therīgāthā, though there are some that are unique to this context, and we also have a prose narrative to flesh out the context. Māra’s challenges are various; sometimes he is sexist, alleging that women are weak in wisdom (SN 5.2). Several of these short texts are among the most frequently quoted of all the suttas.",
  sn6: "The “Linked Discourses with Brahmās” contains 15 discourses featuring high brahmanical deities. Most commonly we meet the “Great Brahmā”, regarded as the creator God, but he is merely one of a class of deities, and here we meet several others. Brahmā is depicted here and elsewhere in early Buddhist texts in a respectful way, regarded as a glorious deity reborn in his realm due to powerful good kamma. As here, he frequently acts as a champion for the Buddhist cause. However, like all the gods, he is still under the influence of delusion and has nor escaped rebirth.",
  sn7: "The “Linked Discourses with Brahmins” contains 22 discourses featuring the Buddha interacting with various members of the brahmanical caste. The brahmins were the custodians of the brahmanical scriptures and traditions, and saw themselves as the spiritual elite of society. A central platform of the Buddha’s ethical teaching was that one’s worth is determined by one’s deeds, not by caste. This was a direct challenge to brahmanical authority, and a number of discourses have an understandably combative air to them. But the brahmins were a diverse community, and it’s just as common to find them relating to the Buddha with respect and gratitude.",
  sn8: "The “Linked Discourses with Vaṅgīsa” contains 12 discourses with verses spoken by Vaṅgīsa, the most renowned poet of early Buddhism. His verses have a sophistication and personal vulnerability that stamp them as perhaps the most distinctive literary voice of the early texts. Several of these discourses speak of his insecurities and struggles, and how he was helped to overcome them. Others speak from his joyous devotion to the Buddha and the Saṅgha, and of his final triumph.",
  sn9: "The “Linked Discourses in the Woods” contains 14 discourses with verses telling the experiences of certain monks living the woods. Typically the monk is slack or negligent in some way, and a deity appears to call them out and encourage them to greater diligence.",
  sn10: "The “Linked Discourses with Spirits” contains 12 discourses with verses telling the encounters between the Buddha—or in one case the monk Anuruddha—and various spirits (yakkha). The spirits were local deities worshiped in ancient India, of a lower order than the gods and Brahmās. While in later forms of Buddhism, such spirits were typically depicted as malevolent or dangerous, in the early texts they are more ambivalent, and many of them are friendly, merely asking Dhamma questions, or extolling Dhamma virtues like mindfulness. That’s not to say they couldn’t be scary, and several discourses reveal a more ferocious aspect. Particularly interesting is the emphasis on the love that the female spirits feel for their children.",
  sn11: "The “Linked Discourses with Sakka” contains 25 discourses with verses telling stories involving Sakka, the Lord of the Thirty-Three gods. Many of these discourses are relatively lengthy, featuring substantive prose and extended dialogues in verse. Sakka is shown devoted to the Buddha, defending Buddhist virtues of kindness and forgiveness, even in the waging of war with the demons.",
  sn12: "The “Linked Discourses on Causation” is a major collection containing 93 discourses on the core Buddhist teaching of dependent origination. Dependent origination presents a series of conditional links laying bare how suffering originates and how it ends. As such, it is an extended treatment of the second and third noble truths. It integrates psychological and existential aspects of suffering, showing how when bound by attachment we make choices that bind us to transmigrating into future lives. One of the core purposes is to explain how rebirth takes place without having to invoke metaphysical concepts such as a “soul”. The collection begins by defining each of the terms in the standard 12-linked chain, definitions which are assumed to apply throughout. Remaining discourses iterate on this theme, introducing new perspectives and formulations. ",
  sn13: "The “Linked Discourses on the Breakthrough” contains 11 discourses on the value of realizing the Dhamma. Each discourse features a memorable simile illustrating the truly momentous implications of seeing the four noble truths.",
  sn14: "The “Linked Discourses on the Elements” contains 39 discourses on various factors classified as “elements” (dhātu). In Buddhism, the term “element” is applied to a range of phenomena, most commonly the main material properties of earth, water, fire and air. Here, however, these four elements play only a small role, and much of the text is devoted to analysis of the perceptual process, and to various character traits. The relation or dependence of elements on each other is a major theme, and this chapter can be seen as an appendix to the chapter on causality.",
  sn15: "The “Linked Discourses on the Unknowable Beginning” contains 20 discourses that speak of how the ultimate origin of the process of transmigration (saṁsāra) is unknowable. This theme is a direct counter to the hubris of the creation myths found in most religions, which confidently recount events which are in fact permanently hidden from view. The Buddha emphasized that transmigration has been ongoing for a fathomless period of time, illustrating it with a series of powerful similes.",
  sn16: "The “Linked Discourses with Kassapa” contains 13 discourses featuring one of the most famous of the Buddha’s disciples, the monk Kassapa. Kassapa was an ascetic and diligent practitioner, whose sometimes critical voice was tempered by a love of nature and a tender concern for the lay community. These discourses show his magnificent spiritual attainments, and his overriding concern for the health and longevity of the Buddhist community.",
  sn17: "The “Linked Discourses on Gains and Honor” contains 43 discourses warning the mendicants of the terrible dangers inherent in material possessions and love of popularity and honors.",
  sn18: "The “Linked Discourses with Rāhula” contains 22 discourses with the Buddha interrogating his son Rāhula on fundamental doctrines such as the aggregates or sense fields.",
  sn19: "The “Linked Discourses with Lakkhaṇa” contains 21 discourses with the Buddha featuring the monk Lakkhaṇa (“Mark”). Through his psychic powers he sees beings in various states of torment and distress, and describes them to the Buddha.",
  sn20: "The “Linked Discourses with Similes” contains 12 discourses with parables or similes illustrating diverse points of the teaching. This chapter highlights the Buddha’s skill in choosing vivid and suitable similes for any occasion.",
  sn21: "The “Linked Discourses with Monks” contains 12 discourses featuring different monks. Unlike the chapter on nuns, this does not use a consistent template, but depicts a diverse range of scenarios. Each case shows a personal challenge or spiritual triumph, shedding a light on the life of the monks.",
  sn22: "The “Linked Discourses on the Aggregates” contains 159 discourses on the core doctrinal topic of the five aggregates. This term was introduced in the first sermon as the summary of the noble truth of suffering, and became a foundational teaching in all forms of Buddhism. The basic idea of an “aggregate” is a set or class of phenomena. The five are form (rūpa, i.e. “physical phenomena”, or sometimes simply “body”; note that in Buddhism, rūpa includes all things with material properties such as shape and color, including visions perceived only in the mind), feeling (vedanā, i.e. the pleasant, painful, or neutral tone of experience), perception (saññā, i.e. the recognition or interpretation of experience, not sense awareness), choices (saṅkhārā, i.e. intention, will, or volition; the choice to perform an act, especially one with an ethical dimension), and consciousness (viññāṇa, i.e. the subjective process of awareness itself). The “aggregates” are the various different phenomena so classified. Almost always, they are referred to as the “aggregates connected with grasping” (upādānakkhandha). The relation between “grasping” and “aggregate” encompasses a number of aspects. The aggregates are the subject of grasping, in that they are the things that are normally attached to and taken to be the permanent “self”. But they are not merely passive spectators: they are also the functional support of grasping, the things that make grasping work. As active participants in the process of grasping, they stimulate grasping to themselves (upādāniya). And finally, they are the product of grasping in the sense that attachments in past lives have given rise to the aggregates in this life (upādinna). One of the key functions of the aggregates is to categorize theories of the self. From the discourses, non-Buddhists seem to be familiar with this, yet we cannot identify the aggregates in any pre-Buddhist texts. Regardless of whether the set of categories was pre-Buddhist, the Buddha treated them in his own distinctive way, emphasizing that nothing in the aggregates was a permanent self or soul. In this collection we find a large number of striking and lively narratives, showing how the aggregates could be a solace at the time of death, a guide to the knotty theoretical debates on identity, or a framework for insight meditation. Many of the short abbreviated texts are built from the same templates employed in the “Linked Discourses on the Six Sense Fields”.",
  sn23: "The “Linked Discourses with Rādha” contains 46 discourses with a monk named Rādha on the topic of the five aggregates, and may be considered as an appendix to the previous saṁyutta. ",
  sn24: "The “Linked Discourses on Views” contains 96 discourses on views, methodically analyzed through the lens of the aggregates. A wide variety of views is assessed, most of which are familiar from elsewhere in the canon, although the first one is unique.",
  sn25: "The “Linked Discourses on Arrival” is the first of three similar sections, each of which takes a set of ten doctrinal items (shared also with SN 18 Rāhula) and presents it according to a set pattern. The current chapter focuses on the distinction between those who accept the teachings by either faith or intellectual understanding, and those who have realized them for themselves.",
  sn26: "The “Linked Discourses on Arising” is the second of three similar sections, each of which takes a set of ten doctrinal items and presents it according to a set pattern. The current chapter focuses on the fact that anyone who has these things will suffer.",
  sn27: "The “Linked Discourses on Corruptions” is the third of three similar sections, each of which takes a set of ten doctrinal items and presents it according to a set pattern. The current chapter focuses on the fact that desire for these things is a corruption of the mind.",
  sn28: "The “Linked Discourses with Sāriputta” describes Sāriputta’s deep meditation practice, and his conversations with Ānanda, who noticed how radiant and glowing he was. An exception to this pattern is the final sutta, which depicts Sāriputta responding to the challenges of a female wanderer.",
  sn29: "The “Linked Discourses on Dragons” is the first of four similar sections dealing with the modes in which various semi-celestial beings may be reborn. The current chapter is on the “dragons” or nāgas, a powerful but morally ambiguous serpentine creature of the waterways.",
  sn30: "The “Linked Discourses on Phoenixes” is the second of four similar sections dealing with the modes in which various semi-celestial beings may be reborn. The current chapter is on the “phoenixes” or supaṇṇas, otherwise known as garuḍa, powerful bird-spirits that are the natural antagonists to the dragons in Indian mythology.",
  sn31: "The “Linked Discourses on Fairies” is the third of four similar sections dealing with the modes in which various semi-celestial beings may be reborn. The current chapter is on the “fairies” or gandhabbas, who take on a number of benign aspects as minor deities associated with music, childbirth, and as here, plants.",
  sn32: "The “Linked Discourses on Cloud Gods” is the last of four similar sections dealing with the modes in which various semi-celestial beings may be reborn. The current chapter is on the “cloud gods” or valāhakas, who are deities of the weather controlling the clouds.",
  sn33: "The “Linked Discourses with Vacchagotta” contains 55 discourses, each with a philosophical inquiry by the wanderer Vacchagotta. These do not exhaust his questions; he also appears in a number of other discourses, notably MN 71–73, where he resolves his doubts and becomes perfected. The current chapter shows him repeatedly raising the question of the ten speculative views, and why they appear. The discourses are entirely formulaic and appear to have been produced from a template. Unusually for a section of this length, it lacks vaggas.",
  sn34: "The “Linked Discourses on Absorption” (Jhānasaṁyutta) is also known as the “Linked Discourses on Immersion” (Samādhisaṁyutta). It contains 55 discourses dealing with the meditative skills required to perfect absorption. Each discourse describes a meditator who is skilled in some aspects, but not in others, and holds the one skilled in all aspects to be the best.",
  sn35: "The number of discourses in the “Linked Discourses on the Six Sense Fields” varies between editions, mainly due to the way repetitions are counted; SuttaCentral follows Bhikkhu Bodhi’s translation in counting 248 discourses. The six sense fields complement the five aggregates as the summary of the noble truth of suffering. Where the aggregates focus on the functional structure of experience as basis for views of self, the emphasis here is on how sense experience stimulates desire. Despite this difference in orientation, the two collections share much in common, and often the exact same template is applied in both cases. The six sense fields are the means through which the world is known, and so each of them has an “inner” and an “outer” aspect—the “eye” and “sights”, etc. Though common, it’s best to avoid thinking of the external sense field as the “object”, since in the suttas they are depicted in relation to the observing mind, and not as independently existing entities. This is straightforward until we come to the last sense, the “mind” and “thoughts” or “mental phenomena”. Just to clear up a possible confusion, this “sixth sense” is simply the mental faculty, and has nothing to do with psychic powers. The outer aspect is dhammā, a term so ambiguous its translation is always difficult. Here it refers to anything that may be known directly by the mind, distinct from the five senses. The most technically correct translation is probably “mental phenomena”, but “thought’ may be used as a more colloquial rendering, so long as it includes ideas, imagination, and so on, not just verbalized cognition.",
  sn36: "The “Linked Discourses on Feelings” contains 31 discourses on the three kinds of feeling. In Sinhalese-script manuscripts, this is reckoned as the last portion of the section on six sense fields. The term “feelings” renders vedanā, which is the simple affective or hedonic tone of experience as pleasant, painful, and neutral, rather than the complex states we call “emotions”. In the process of experience, feeling emerges from sense contact, and stimulates craving. One of the aims of mental development is to first loosen, then eliminate that second link, so that one still has feelings, but does not experience craving for them. The current collection includes a number of rich and significant discourses on this theme.",
  sn37: "The “Linked Discourses on Females” contains 34 discourses regarding various qualities of women. Note that the Pali texts use two distinct terms for women, itthī and mātugāma, the latter of which can be translated as “females”. These texts deal with such themes as the kinds of suffering unique to women, why women are reborn in various states, or the qualities that lead to a woman taking charge in her marriage.",
  sn38: "The “Linked Discourses with Jambukhādaka” contains 16 discourses recording the answers given by Sāriputta to the questions of a wanderer named Jambukhādaka. The questions cover a wide range of themes, from the nature of extinguishment to the difficulty of practicing the Dhamma. This chapter is practically identical to the next, differing only in the name of the wanderer.",
  sn39: "The “Linked Discourses with Sāmaṇḍaka” contains 16 discourses recording the answers given by Sāriputta to the questions of a wanderer named Sāmaṇḍaka. The questions cover a wide range of themes, from the nature of extinguishment to the difficulty of practicing the Dhamma. This chapter is practically identical to the previous, differing only in the name of the wanderer, and the Pali editions abbreviate, instructing that it is to be expanded.",
  sn40: "The “Linked Discourses with Moggallāna” contains 11 discourses featuring Moggallāna, one of the chief disciples. He tells the monks of his struggles in meditation, and how he was encouraged by the Buddha. In the last two discourses, he visit the heavens and teaches the gods.",
  sn41: "The “Linked Discourses with Citta” contains 10 discourses featuring the householder Citta, who was praised by the Buddha as the foremost lay disciple in speaking on the Dhamma. Here he engages in a series of insightful and sharp-witted dialogues with various monks. Citta emerges as a distinctive personality, knowledgeable and witty, curious and incisive, with no lack of humor. But he is more than just a clever speaker, for he also lays claim to exalted meditation and spiritual attainments.",
  sn42: "The “Linked Discourses with Chiefs” contains 13 discourses featuring various headmen or chiefs. They sometimes ask questions relating to their professions, from entertainers to warriors, while several discourses touch on familiar Dhamma themes, such as overcoming anger, the validity of brahmanical rites, or whether monastics should use money. Some of the chiefs are quite adversarial, aiming to trip up the Buddha in debate, or accusing him of being a magician. In the end, though, the Buddha’s compassionate and measured responses win them over.",
  sn43: "The “Linked Discourses on the Unconditioned” contains 44 discourses on the theme of the unconditioned, i.e. nibbāna or “extinguishment”. They focus on the various practices that lead to the unconditioned. This chapter includes an extensive range of terms and idioms describing the final goal of Buddhist practice.",
  sn44: "The “Linked Discourses on the Undeclared” contains 44 discourses on the theme of the ten “undeclared” questions. These are a stock series of metaphysical hypotheses, which the Buddha dismissed as being based on the implicit assumption of a self, and hence as being counterproductive to liberation. The first discourse here features a conversation between King Pasenadi and the nun Khemā on this topic.",
  sn45: "The “Linked Discourses on the Path” contains 180 discourses on the noble eightfold path, the “middle way” which is the first and most important of all the Buddha’s teachings on the path of spiritual practice. It is mentioned in the first discourse as the fourth noble truth. It begins with “right view” which is initially an accurate conceptual understanding, based on hearing the teachings and reflecting on their meaning. The second factor is right intention, referring to the attitude or motivation that shapes practice. Next come three factors dealing with ethical conduct. And the final three factors directly deal with meditation. Once all these factors are mature, “right immersion” or the four absorptions (jhānas) enables the initial conceptual understanding to ascend to a higher level of insight and letting go. While this and subsequent chapters contains many substantive discourses on this theme, the large number of discourses is mainly attributable to the formulaic “repetition series” which append each chapter.",
  sn46: "The “Linked Discourses on the Awakening Factors” contains 184 discourses on the seven awakening factors. These are qualities such as mindfulness and investigation which lead the meditator to awakening. The focus here is specifically on meditation, rather than the more holistic approach included in the previous chapter on the Path. Some distinctive features of this collection include the use recitation of the awakening factors in order to inspire those who are sick, and the frequent contrast between the seven awakening factors and the five hindrances.",
  sn47: "The “Linked Discourses on Mindfulness Meditation” contains 104 discourses on the four kinds of mindfulness meditation (satipaṭṭhāna, otherwise known as the “foundations of mindfulness” or “establishments of mindfulness”). These are the body, feelings, mind, and principles. The last of these is translated in various ways, but a close reading of the texts in this chapter shows that it originally referred to the “principles” of causality underlying the process of meditation itself. These discourses on this fundamental topic are much less known than the longer “Discourse on Mindfulness Meditation” found in versions in MN 10 and DN 22; however, they are historically earlier than that late compilation. Where MN 10 emphasizes insight meditation, in this collection we frequently find mindfulness closely connected to absorption, as it is the factor of the path that leads directly to “right immersion”. Insight is mentioned only rarely. The root meaning of the term mindfulness (sati) is “memory”, and when used in meditation it refers to not “forgetting” one’s meditation, but keeping focus on the breath or other theme of meditation. This collection presents a range of perspectives on mindfulness meditation; one of its most memorable features is a series of similes or parables illustrating the practice. The partner of mindfulness (sati) is “situational awareness” (sampajañña, sometimes rendered as “clear comprehension”), which refers to keeping a broad awareness and understanding especially in daily activities.",
  sn48: "The “Linked Discourses on the Faculties” contains 178 discourses on various sets of “faculties” (indriya). The “five faculties” of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom are the most natural fit in this context. However the chapter also finds room for discourses on a wider range of 22 faculties, including the six sense faculties, five affective faculties (kinds of feeling), three faculties relating the process of enlightenment, and three concerning biology and gender. This flexible category thus serves as a link between the teachings on wisdom and those on the path.",
  sn49: "The “Linked Discourses on the Right Efforts” contains 54 discourses, which are, however, a mere instantiation of the standard repetition series as applied to the four right efforts. There are many discourses on right effort throughout the Pali nikāyas, but for some reason the redactors did not collect them here.",
  sn50: "The “Linked Discourses on the Five Powers” contains 108 discourses, which are, however, a mere instantiation of the standard repetition series as applied to the five powers. These powers are effectively identical with the five faculties, as stated at SN 48.43, being merely distinguished as a different teaching approach. There are several discourses on these qualities found mainly in the Aṅguttara Fives, but for some reason the redactors did not collect them here.",
  sn51: "The “Linked Discourses on the Bases of Psychic Power” contains 86 discourses dealing with the qualities of enthusiasm or desire for practice, energy, higher consciousness, and inquiry, which are said to lead to the development of various psychic powers. The purpose of Buddhism, of course, is not to develop such powers. But they are a matter of constant interest and intrigue among spiritual practitioners—not just in ancient India—and it seems the Buddha formulated this approach to the path to inspire those interested in them. The emphasis is on the development of deep meditation immersion (samādhi) through applying effort.",
  sn52: "The “Linked Discourses with Anuruddha” contains 24 discourses with Anuruddha, famous for his powers of clairvoyance, but here revealed as an exponent of mindfulness meditation. It is to mindfulness meditation that he attributes his spiritual attainments, whether psychic powers, absorptions, or awakening. This series of texts can be regarded as a supplement to SN 47.",
  sn53: "The “Linked Discourses on Absorption” contains 54 discourses on the topic of absorption meditation (jhāna), which however merely apply the standard repetition series to the formula for the four absorptions.",
  sn54: "The “Linked Discourses on Breath Meditation” contains 20 discourses on breath meditation (ānāpānassati), the most revered form of meditation from early Buddhism until the present day. It was practiced by the Buddha himself. The meditation is taught in a detailed series of sixteen steps. These are partially sequential, but also overlap in some cases. The development of these fulfills all four kinds of mindfulness meditation and the seven factors of awakening. Thus this one form of meditation can lead to awakening; which is not, however, to say that it is invariably the best approach. The Buddha taught many different meditations for a reason; each has its own qualities and benefits. Breath meditation is seen as a peaceful and pleasant meditation which helps still distracting thoughts. It is a simple practice broadly suitable for most meditators, but leading to profound depths.",
  sn55: "The “Linked Discourses on Stream-Entry” contains 74 discourses on the topic of stream-entry, or more precisely, two sets of four qualities, one of which distinguishes a person as a stream-enterer, and one which help lead to stream-entry. The primary qualities of the first set are faith and ethical conduct. For the second, it is hearing the teaching and practicing accordingly. Note that these sets do not exhaust the qualities of a stream-enterer, many others of which are described elsewhere, but serve to emphasis the crucial role especially of faith.",
  sn56: "The “Linked Discourses on the Truths” contains 131 discourses on the four noble truths: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. These formed the main subject of the Buddha’s first discourse, which is included here as SN 56.11. The Buddha said that all of his teaching was comprised within the four noble truths. Indeed, the overall structure of the main doctrinal Saṁyuttas can be seen as an expanded example of this: The sections on the Aggregates and the Sense Fields deal with the first noble truth; Dependent Origination deals with the second and third; and the chapters on the Path deal with the final truth. This chapter thus provides an overall perspective on the other teachings, and the chapter occurs at the end just as the realization of the four noble truths emerges from the path.",

The daughter, we learn, of a wealthy merchant of Rajagaha was deeply rooted in goodness and scorned all temporal things; she had reached her final existence, and within her breast, like a lamp in a pitcher, glowed her sure hope of winning Arahatship. As soon as she reached knowledge of herself, she took no joy in a worldly life but yearned to renounce the world. With this aim, she said to her mother and father, “My dear parents, my heart takes no joy in a worldly life; fain would I embrace the saving doctrine of the Buddha. Suffer me to take the vows.”",
  ja13: "“Cursed be the dart of love.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana about the temptation caused to Brethren by the wives of their mundane life.

Can it be, sir, that there is any good in this?”",
  ja19: "“Take thought of life hereafter.” This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana about the offering of a sacrifice under vow to gods. Tradition says that in those days folk when going a journey on business, used to slay living creatures and offer them as a sacrifice to gods, and set out on their way, after making this vow,—“If we come safely back with a profit, we will give you another sacrifice.” And when they did come safely back with a profit, the Idea that this was all due to gods made them slay a number of living creatures and offer them up as a sacrifice to obtain a release from their vow.",
  ja20: "“I found the footprints.” This story was told by the Master whilst journeying on an alms-pilgrimage through Kosala, when he had come to the village of Nalaka-pana (Cane-drink) and was dwelling at Ketaka-vana near the Pool of Nalaka-pana, about cane-sticks. In those days the Brethren, after bathing in the Pool of Nalaka-pana, made the novices get them cane-sticks for needle-cases, but, finding them hollow throughout, went to the Master and said, “Sir, we had cane-sticks got in order to provide needle-cases; and from top to bottom they are quite hollow. Now how can that be?”",
  ja21: "“The antelope knows well.”—This story was told by the Master while at the Bamboo-grove about Devadatta. For once when the Brethren were gathered together in the Hall of Truth, they sat talking reproachfully of Devadatta, saying, “Sirs, with a view to destroy the Buddha Devadatta hired bowmen, hurled down a rock, and let loose the elephant Dhana-palaka; in every way he goes about to slay the Lord of Wisdom.” Entering and seating himself on the seat prepared for him, the Master asked, saying, “Sirs, what is the theme you are discussing here in conclave?” “Sir,” was the reply, “we were discussing the wickedness of Devadatta, saying that he was always going about to slay you.” Said the Master, “It is not only in these present days, Brethren, that Devadatta goes about seeking to slay me; he went about with the like intent in bygone days also,—but was unable to slay me.” And so saying, he told this story of the past.",

All this gain and honour brought Devadatta a great following, with whom Devadatta lived on, without ever stirring out of his Monastery.",

This the Brethren reported to the Blessed One, who sent for the Six and asked whether this charge was true. On their admitting its truth, he rebuked them, saying, “Brethren, hard words gall even animals: in bygone days an animal made a man who had used harsh language to him lose a thousand pieces.” And, so saying, he told this story of the past.",

  ja45: "“Sense-lacking friends.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about a maid servant of the Lord High Treasurer, Anatha-pindika. For he is said to have had a maid-servant named Rohini, whose aged mother came to where the girl was pounding rice, and lay down. The flies came round the old woman and stung her as with a needle, so she cried to her daughter, “The flies are stinging me, my dear; do drive them away.” “Oh! I’ll drive them away, mother,” said the girl, lifting her pestle to the flies which had settled on her mother.

It appears that a certain squire of Savatthi had invited the Brotherhood with the Buddha at their head, and had seated them in his pleasaunce, where they were regaled with rice-gruel and cakes. Afterwards he bade his gardener go round with the Brethren and give mangoes and other kinds of fruits to their Reverences. In obedience to orders, the man walked about the grounds with the Brethren, and could tell by a single glance up at the tree what fruit was green, what nearly ripe, and what quite ripe, and so on. And what he said was always found true. So the Brethren came to the Buddha and mentioned how expert the gardener was, and how, whilst himself standing on the ground, he could accurately tell the condition of the hanging fruit. “Brethren,” said the Master, “this gardener is not the only one who has had knowledge of fruits. A like knowledge was shewn by the wise and good of former days also.” And so saying, he told this story of the past.",

His teachers and masters proceeded to instruct him in the whole of the Ten Precepts of Morality, one after the other, expounded to him the Short, the Medium, and the Long Moralities, set forth the Morality which rests on self-restraint according to the Patimokkha, the Morality which rests on self-restraint as to the Senses, the Morality which rests on a blameless walk of life, the Morality which relates to the way a Brother may use the Requisites. Thought the young beginner, “There is a tremendous lot of this Morality; and I shall undoubtedly fail to fulfil all I have vowed. Yet what is the good of being a brother at all, if one cannot keep the rules of Morality? My best course is to go back to the world, take a wife and rear children, living a life of almsgiving and other good works.” So he told his superiors what he thought, saying that he proposed to return to the lower state of a layman, and wished to hand back his bowl and robes. “Well, if it be so with you,” said they, “at least take leave of the Buddha before you go;” and they brought the young man before the Master in the Hall of Truth.",

Tradition says that there dwelt at Savatthi a lay-brother, who was stablished in the Three Gems and the Five Commandments, a devout lover of the Buddha, the Doctrine and the Brotherhood. But his wife was a sinful and wicked woman. On days when she did wrong, she was as meek as a slave-girl bought for a hundred pieces; whilst on days when she did not do wrong, she played my lady, passionate and tyrannical. The husband could not make her out. She worried him so much that he did not go to wait on the Buddha.",
  ja65: "“Like highways.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about just such another lay-brother as the last. This man, when on enquiry he assured himself of his wife’s misconduct, came to words with her, with the result that he was so upset that for seven or eight days he failed in his attendance. One day he came to the monastery, made his bow to the Blessed One and took his seat. Being asked why he had been absent for seven or eight days, he replied, “Sir, my wife has misconducted herself, and I have been so upset about her that I did not come.”",
  ja66: "“Till Gentle-heart was mine.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about concupiscence. Tradition says that a young gentleman of Savatthi, [30;3] on hearing the Truth preached by the Master, gave his heart to the Doctrine of the Three Gems. Renouncing the world for the Brother’s life, he rose to walk in the Paths, to practise meditation, and never to slacken in his pondering over the theme he had chosen for thought. One day, whilst he was on his round for alms through Savatthi, he espied a woman in brave attire, and, for pleasure’s sake, broke through the higher morality and gazed upon her! Passion was stirred within him, he became even as a fig-tree felled by the axe. From that day forth, under the sway of passion, the palate of his mind, as of his body, lost all its gust; like a brute beast, he took no joy in the Doctrine, and suffered his nails and hair to grow long and his robes to grow foul.",

Tradition says that when the Blessed One with his disciples was entering the city of Saketa, an old brahmin of that place, who was going out, met him in the gateway. Falling at the Buddha’s feet, and clasping him by the ankles, the old man cried, “Son, is it not the duty of children to cherish the old age of their parents? Why have you not let us see you all this long time? At last I have seen you; come, let your mother see you too.” So saying, he took the Master with him to his house; and there the Master sat upon the seat prepared for him, with his disciples around him. Then came the brahmin’s wife, and she too fell at the feet of the Blessed One, crying, “My son, where have you been all this time? Is it not the duty of children to comfort their parents in their old age?” Hereon, she called to her sons and daughters that their brother was come, and made them salute the Buddha. And in their joy the aged pair shewed great hospitality to their guests. After his meal, the Master recited to the old people the Sutta concerning old-age; and, when he had ended, both husband and wife won fruition of the Second Path. Then rising up from his seat, the Master went back to Anjanavana.",
  ja69: "“May shame.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana about Sariputta, the Captain of the Faith. Tradition says that in the days when the Elder used to eat meal-cakes, folks came to the monastery with a quantity of such cakes for the Brotherhood. After the Brethren had all eaten their fill, much remained over; and the givers said, “Sirs, take some for those too who are away in the village.”",
  ja70: "“The conquest.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about the Elder named Cittahattha-Sariputta. He is said to have been a youth of a good family in Savatthi; and one day, on his way home from ploughing, he turned in to the monastery. Here he received from the bowl of a certain Elder some dainty fare, rich and sweet, which made him think to himself,—“Day and night I am toiling away with my hands at divers tasks, yet never do I taste food so sweet. I must turn Brother myself!” So he joined the Brotherhood, but after six weeks’ zealous application to high thinking, fell under the dominion of Lusts and off he went. His belly again proving too much for him, back he came to join the Brotherhood once more, and studied the Abhidhamma. In this way, six times he left and came back again; but when for the seventh time he became a Brother, he mastered the whole seven books of the Abhidhamma, and by much chanting of the Doctrine of the Brothers won Discernment and attained to Arahatship. Now his friends among the Brethren scoffed at him, saying—“Can it be, sir, that Lusts have ceased to spring up within your heart?”",
  ja71: "“Learn thou from him.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about the Elder named Tissa the Squire’s Son. Tradition says that one day thirty young gentlemen of Savatthi, who were all friends of one another, took perfumes and flowers and robes, and set out with a large retinue to Jetavana, in order to hear the Master preach. Arrived at Jetavana, they sat awhile in the several enclosures—in the enclosure of the Iron-wood trees, in the enclosure of the Sal-trees, and so forth,—till at evening the Master passed from his fragrant sweet-smelling perfumed chamber to the Hall of Truth and took his seat on the gorgeous Buddha-seat. Then, with their following, these young men went to the Hall of Truth, made an offering of perfumes and flowers, bowed down at his feet—those blessed feet that were glorious as full-blown lotus-flowers, and bore imprinted on the sole the Wheel!—and, taking their seats, listened to the Truth. Then the thought came into their minds, “Let us take the vows, so far as we understand the Truth preached by the Master.” Accordingly, when the Blessed One left the Hall, they approached him and with due obeisance asked to be admitted to the Brotherhood; and the Master admitted them to the Brotherhood. Winning the favour of their teachers and directors they received full Brotherhood, and after five years’ residence with their teachers and directors, by which time they had got by heart the two Abstracts, had come to know what was proper and what was improper, had learnt the three modes of expressing thanks, and had stitched and dyed robes. At this stage, wishing to embrace the ascetic life, they obtained the consent of their teachers and directors, and approached the Master. Bowing before him they took their seats, saying, “Sir, we are troubled by the round of existence, dismayed by birth, decay, disease, and death; give us a theme, by thinking on which we may get free from the elements which occasion existence.” The Master turned over in his mind the eight and thirty themes of thought, and therefrom selected a suitable one, which he expounded to them. And then, after getting their theme from the Master, they bowed and with a ceremonious farewell passed from his presence to their cells, and after gazing on their teachers and directors went forth with bowl and robe to embrace the ascetic life.",
  ja72: "“Ingratitude lacks more.”—This story was told by the Master while at the Bamboo-grove about Devadatta. The Brethren sat in the Hall of Truth, saying, “Sirs, Devadatta is an ingrate and does not recognise the virtues of the Blessed One.” Returning to the Hall, the Master asked what topic they were discussing, and was told. “This is not the first time, Brethren,” said he, “that Devadatta has proved an ingrate; he was just the same in bygone days also, and he has never known my virtues.” And so saying, at their request he told this story of the past.",
  ja73: "“They knew the world.”—This story was told by the Master while at the Bamboo-grove, about going about to kill. For, seated in the Hall of Truth, the Brotherhood was talking of Devadatta’s wickedness, saying, “Sirs, Devadatta has no knowledge of the Master’s excellence; he actually goes about to kill him!” Here the Master entered the Hall and asked what they were discussing. 323] Being told, he said, “This is not the first time, Brethren, that Devadatta has gone about to kill me; he did just the same in bygone days also.” And so saying, he told this story of the past.",

Knowing of this, he passed through the air, sat cross-legged above the river Rohini, and emitted rays of darkness, startling his kinsfolk. Then descending from mid-air, he seated himself on the river-bank and told this story with reference to that quarrel. (Only a summary is given here; the full details will be related in the Kunala-jataka.) But on this occasion the Master addressed his kinsfolk, saying, “It is meet, sire, that kinsfolk should dwell together in concord and unity. For, when kinsfolk are at one, enemies find no opportunity. Not to speak of human beings, even sense-lacking trees ought to stand together. For in bygone days in the Himalayas a tempest struck a Sal-forest; yet, because the trees, shrubs, bushes, and creepers of that forest were interlaced one with another, the tempest could not overthrow even a single tree but passed harmlessly over their heads. But alone in a courtyard stood a mighty tree; and though it had many stems and branches, yet, because it was not united with other trees, the tempest uprooted it and laid it low. Wherefore, it is meet that you too should dwell together in concord and unity.” And so saying, at their request he told this story of the past.",
  ja75: "“Pajjunna, thunder!”—This story the Master told while at Jetavana, about the rain he caused to fall. For in those days, so it is said, there fell no rain in Kosala; the crops withered; and everywhere the ponds, tanks, and lakes dried up. Even the pool of Jetavana by the embattled gateway of Jetavana gave out; and the fish and tortoises buried themselves in the mud. Then came the crows and hawks with their lance-like beaks, and busily picked them out writhing and wriggling, and devoured them.",
  ja76: "“The village breeds no fear in me.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about a lay-brother who lived at Savatthi. Tradition says that this man, who had entered the Paths and was an earnest believer, was once journeying along on some business or other in the company of a leader of a caravan; in the jungle the carts were unyoked and a laager was constructed; and the good man began to pace up and down at the foot of a certain tree hard by the leader.",
  ja77: "“Bulls first, and trees.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana about sixteen wonderful dreams.

Now, when the night grew light, his brahmins and chaplains came to him and with due obeisance asked whether his majesty had slept well.",

Hard by the city of Rajagaha, as we are told, was a town named Jagghery, and here dwelt a certain Lord High Treasurer, known as the Millionaire Miser, who was worth eighty crores! Not so much as the tiniest drop of oil that a blade of grass will take up, did he either give away or consume for his own enjoyment. So he made no use of all his wealth either for his family or for sages and brahmins: it remained unenjoyed,—like a pool haunted by demons. Now, it fell out on a day that the Master arose at dawn moved with a great compassion, and as he reviewed those ripe for conversion throughout the universe, he became aware that this Treasurer with his wife some four hundred miles away were destined to tread the Paths of Salvation.",

Tradition says that he used to gather round him Brethren of all ages, and go about deluding everyone with lying boasts about his noble descent. “Ah, Brethren,” he would say, “there’s no family so noble as mine, no lineage so peerless. I am a scion of the highest of princely lines; no man is my equal in birth or ancestral estate; there is absolutely no end to the gold and silver and other treasures we possess. Our very slaves and menials are fed on rice and meat-stews, and are clad in the best Benares cloth, with the choicest Benares perfumes to perfume themselves withal; whilst I, because I have joined the Brotherhood, [3561 have to content myself with this vile fare and this vile garb.”",

  bipd: "The rules in this category are known in Pali as pāṭidesanīya, “entailing acknowledgement”. There are eight such rules for the nuns. These eight rules for the nuns are equivalent to a single rule for the monks (bhikkhu-pācittiya 39). In summary, they say that a nun who asks for special food must acknowledge the offense.",
  bisk: "The rules in this category are known in Pali as sekhiya, “involving training”. There are seventy-five such rules, and they are the same both for the monks and the nuns. The sekhiyas are mostly rules of etiquette. Breaking a sekhiya is only considered to be a transgression if the offender is acting out of disrespect for the rule.",
  bias: "There are seven adhikaraṇasamathadhamma, “principles for the settling of legal issues”, which are the same for the nuns and the monks. These are not rules in the ordinary sense and as such fall outside of the classification into serious and light offenses. Instead, they set out the proper methods for dealing with legal issues. The detailed explanation for these is found in the Samathakkhandhaka. The legal issues to be settled through these principles fall into four categories: disputes, accusations, offenses, and proceedings. “Proceedings” includes monastic procedures such as ordination and the keeping of the observance day (uposatha).",
  bias1:
    "A legal issue can only be resolved if all those concerned are present during the process. In addition the procedure must comply with all aspects of monastic law.",
  bias2:
    "If a nun is known for her clarity of memory, any accusations against her may be settled through that nun declaring her innocence based on her memory of the relevant events.",
  bias3:
    "A nun who is insane is not responsible for her own offenses. Any offenses she may have committed while insane can be cleared through a declaration of past insanity.",
  bias4:
    "All offenses, except those entailing expulsion, should be cleared by making amends in the appropriate manner.",
  bias5: "A dispute that drags on without resolution may be settled through majority vote.",
  bias6: "A nun who is intractable in regard to the offenses she has committed may be subject to an act of censure.",
  bias7:
    "If a dispute involves a number of offenses on both sides, and the Order considers that dealing with all the offenses in the usual manner is likely to lead to harshness or schism, then the Order may decide to do a procedure whereby all the offenses are cleared. Offenses that cannot be cleared in this way are those entailing expulsion and suspension, as well as any offenses that involve lay people.",
  kd1: "The Mahākhandhaka, “the Great chapter”, begins by telling the story of the Buddha after his awakening. Three of the Buddha’s first and most well-known discourses—the Setting in motion of the wheel of the Teaching, the Characteristics of non-self, and the Discourse on fire—are given in full. As he starts to accumulate disciples, an ordination procedure gradually evolves. A large number of rules that concern ordination, especially about the eligibility of the candidate, are laid down, as are rules governing the relationship between teacher and student, including rules about novices.",
  kd2: "The Uposathakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on the observance day”, lays down the rules concerning the twice-monthly observance day, the uposatha, which is kept on the day of the full moon and the new moon. It is on these days that the main rules binding on all monastics, the Monastic Code or the Pātimokkha, is recited. The chapter also gives the rules regarding the boundary, the sīmā, that defines the extent of a single monastic community. Rules on making amends for offenses are also found here.",
  kd3: "The Vassūpanāyikakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on entering the rainy-season residence”, prohibits monastics from traveling during three months of the rainy season. Instead they should enter the rainy-season residence in a suitable place. It then gives a number of exemptions because of which a monastic may travel for a maximum of seven days to look after urgent business.",
  kd4: "The Pavāraṇākhandhaka, “the Chapter on the invitation ceremony”, concerns the rules that apply to the ceremony of inviting correction from one’s fellow monastics. This ceremony is held annually at the very end of the rain-season residence, and is compulsory for all monastics.",
  kd5: "The Cammakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on skins”, contains rules on the use of footwear and skins, as well as vehicles and beds. The chapter includes the inspiring stories of the monk Soṇa Koḷivisa who was the Buddha’s foremost disciple in putting forth energy and the monk Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa who became a monk in the distant country of Avantī where Buddhism had barely arrived. It also mentions a number of rules that are relaxed for lands outside of the middle Ganges plain.",
  kd6: "The Bhesajjakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on medicines”, concerns allowable medicines and medical treatment. The rules laid down here include prohibitions against various kinds of meat and against cooking by monastics. The chapter contains the remarkable story of the monk Pilindavaccha and his supernormal powers. It also features the stories of the courtesan Ambapālī offering her mango grove to the Sangha, the conversion of general Sīha, and the exceptional layman Meṇḍaka, after whom the Meṇḍaka allowance is named. This allowance enables lay supporters to deposit a fund with a steward, who is to be approached by a designated monastic in need of requisites. The chapter concludes with four general standards to help monastics decide what is and what is not allowable.",
  kd7: "The Kathinakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on the robe-making ceremony”, describes the procedure and rules for the robe-making ceremony that is normally held in the last month of the rainy season, after the rainy-season residence has been completed. Once this ceremony has been performed, the robe-making season lasts until the end of the cold season, unless certain conditions are fulfilled. Most of this chapter consists of a detailed analysis of those conditions.",
  kd8: "The Cīvarakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on robe-cloth”, gives a number of rules on robes, robe-cloth, and dyeing equipment, as well as rules on inheritance. Here we find the long story of the doctor Jīvaka, the Buddha’s personal physician, and the story of Visākha, the Buddha’s main female lay supporter, who shows her understanding of the connection between generosity and success in meditation. This chapter also contains the inspiring story of the Buddha and Ānanda washing a monk who has dysentery.",
  kd9: "The Campeyyakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on those from Campā”, contains a technical discussion on the validity of formal monastic procedures, saṅghakamma. The chapter starts with the story of the monk Kassapagotta who is maliciously accused of having committed an offense.",
  kd10: "The Kosambakakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on those from Kosambī”, discusses how to deal with a split in the Sangha. The chapter begins with the story of “the Kosambī incident”, which led to a serious dispute and spilt in the Sangha. The Buddha tells the story of Dīghāvu, a longer version of the Kosambiya Jātaka of the Jātaka collection, in an attempt at getting the monks to come to their senses. Failing at this, he goes to visit the three friends Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila, who exemplify the art of living in harmony.",
  kd11: "The Kammakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on procedures”, describes in technical detail the validity of formal procedures that involve sanctions against an offender. The chapter discusses the enactment of such procedures, the mode of conduct required of the offender to deserve release, and the lifting of the procedure.",
  kd12: "The Pārivāsikakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on those on probation”, contains a detailed description of the conduct required of a monastic who has committed an offense entailing suspension, a saṅghādisesa, so as to deserve rehabilitation.",
  kd13: "The Samuccayakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on accumulation”, describes in detail the process of making amends for a monastic who has committed an offense entailing suspension, a saṅghādisesa.",
  kd14: "The Samathakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on the settling of legal issues”, gives a detailed description of how the principles for the resolution of legal issues (the adhikaraṇasamathadhamma), the last seven “rules” of the Monastic Code, are to be applied in practice. The chapter includes a technical discussion on the nature of the four kinds of legal issues.",
  kd15: "The Khuddakavatthukkhandhaka, “the Chapter with short topics”, contains a large and diverse number of minor rules, including rules on allowable buildings. A recurrent theme is that luxurious items and sensual indulgence are not allowed. The verses to protect against dangerous insects and snakes, the so-called Khandhaparitta, are found here. The procedure of “overturning the bowl” is described, a procedure used against lay people who act against the interest of Buddhism. This chapter also includes the much-debated instruction for monastics to learn the Teachings using the Buddha’s own way of expression.",
  kd16: "The Senāsanakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on dwellings”, gives further rules on allowable buildings, including allowable methods for constructing and finishing them, as well as allowable furnishings. A number of minor rules are laid down, as are the procedures for appointing community officials. The chapter tells the story of Anāthapiṇḍika, perhaps the greatest benefactor of Buddhism in the very earliest period. Here we also find the Tittira Jātaka tale, “the Partridge Jātaka”, found in a slightly different form in the Jātaka collection.",
  kd17: "The Saṅghabhedakakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on schism”, begins by telling the story of the going forth of a number of the Buddha’s relatives, including Anuruddha and Devadatta. The story continues with Devadatta’s ambition to lead the Sangha—including the story of King Ajātasattu murdering his father and Devadatta’s attempts to kill the Buddha—his actions eventually resulting in schism. As part of this the Buddha lays down an “announcement procedure”, pakāsanīyakamma, by which the Sangha can distance itself from the actions of any particular individual. The chapter concludes with a technical discussion on schism.",
  kd18: "The Vattakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on conduct”, lays down the rules of conduct that apply in a variety of circumstances, such as those between teacher and student; those for visiting, resident, and departing monastics; those for alms-round and forest dwelling; those for dining halls, dwellings, restrooms, and saunas.",
  kd19: "The Pātimokkhaṭṭhapanakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on the cancellation of the Monastic Code”, allows a monastic to exclude another from the Pātimokkha recitation if they have not confessed their offenses beforehand. This chapter also describes the qualities that should be present in oneself before correcting another.",
  kd20: "The Bhikkhunikkhandhaka, “the Chapter on nuns”, comprises all the rules outside of the Monastic Code, the Pātimokkha, that are specific to the nuns, including the ordination ceremony and ordination by messenger. The chapter begins with the ordination of Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, which marks the beginning of the Sangha of nuns.",
  kd21: "The Pañcasatikakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on the assembly of five hundred”, tells the story of the first communal recitation (saṅgīti) of the discourses of the Buddha at Rājagaha, otherwise known as “the first council”. Ānanda, the Buddha’s personal attendant, recited the discourses, while Upāli recited the Monastic Law.",
  kd22: "The Sattasatikakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on the assembly of seven hundred”, tells the story of a major disagreement in the Sangha about aspects of the Monastic Law, most importantly about the use of money. After a long process, it is agreed that monastics may not use money. This episode is often referred to as “the second council”.",
